This repository contains implementations of regression and classification algorithms using Linear Regression, Bayesian Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The code is designed to demonstrate the application of these algorithms on various datasets.

## Requirements

````bash
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- CVXOPT
- Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:
